Kohli is a former T20I player and a former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in  IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Hence, Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and the modern era. Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[5]\\nIn 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of T20I rankings.[6] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.[7]\\nKohli has received many accolades for his performances in cricket. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India\\'s highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.\\nAfter winning the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup, Kohli announced his retirement from T20I.[8]\\n\\n\\nEarly life\\nVirat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[9]  Kohli\\'s formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to him.[11]\\nIn 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who\\'d espoused his younger son\\'s fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli\\'s aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[12] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli\\'s father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[13] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[14] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[15] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[13]\\nOn 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[13][16] During his childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father\\'s presence at times.[10][17] According to his mother, Kohli\\'s demeanour shifted noticeably after his father\\'s death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[13] Kohli\\'s family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[18]\\n\\nCareer\\nMain article: Career of Virat Kohli\\nPlayer profile\\nComparisons to Sachin Tendulkar\\nKohli\\'s batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar\\'s \"successor\",[19][20] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[21][22] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar\\'s style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[23] Kohli\\'s aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli\\'s similarities to his own playing style.[24] He has been lauded as the \"new king of world cricket\" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[25] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[26] Kohli\\'s skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[27]\\nIn a discourse with the prominent Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli\\'s batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs.[28] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of an era for Indian cricket. Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been gifted to him by his late father. Tendulkar eventually returned the thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his possession.[29]\\n\\nPlaying style\\nKohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.[30][31] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[32] and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[33][34] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[35][36]\\n\\nKohli playing his famous flick shot at the 2015 Cricket World Cup\\nKohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[11] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli\\'s batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[37] Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[38] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.[39]\\nHowever, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[40] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[41] This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli\\'s dismissal on numerous occasions.[42][43] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[44][45] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[46]\\nKohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batsman by cricketing experts and aficionados alike.[47][48] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first.[49] He has amassed 27 of his 50 ODI hundreds in run-chases,[50] and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second.[51] In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.[52] His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.[53][54]\\n\\nAggression\\nKohli\\'s playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He is well known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce competitiveness.[55][56] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team by example.[57] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former cricketers alike.[58][59] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[60][61] others have criticized Kohli\\'s behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[62] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[63] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli\\'s self-assuredness and \"assertiveness\" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.[64]\\n\\nPublic image and in media\\nVirat Kohli with Audi Q7\\nIn 2008, Kohli was approached by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after his notable performance in the ICC Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh was impressed with Kohli\\'s leadership skills and attitude and saw great potential in the young cricketer. After being recommended by Yuvraj Singh, Kohli was signed to Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment.[65] Over the years, Kohli\\'s brand endorsement portfolio has experienced significant growth. In 2013, it was reported that his endorsements were valued at over ₹1 billion (US$12\\xa0million).[66] Now in 2023, his brand value has reached ₹1,000 crore (US$120\\xa0million).[67] His bat deal with MRF is regarded as one of the most financially rewarding deals in cricket history.[68] In 2017, Kohli entered into a notable endorsement agreement with Puma that spanned over eight years and was estimated to be worth around ₹1.1 billion (US$13\\xa0million). This deal made Kohli the first Indian athlete to sign a brand endorsement contract valued at ₹100 crore (equivalent to ₹140\\xa0crore or US$17\\xa0million in 2023) deal with a brand.[69] As of January\\xa02023[update], Kohli is widely regarded as the most marketable cricketer, with annual earnings estimated at  ₹165 crore (equivalent to ₹175\\xa0crore or US$21\\xa0million in 2023).[70] Kohli is currently recognized as the most followed Asian individual on the social media platform Instagram, boasting over 266 million followers on the platform. Reports indicate that he is able to command a fee of ₹8.9 crore (equivalent to ₹9.4\\xa0crore or US$1.1\\xa0million in 2023) for each sponsored post on the platform.[71]\\n\\nVirat Kohli\\'s signed bat at Blades of Glory Cricket Museum, Pune\\nKohli has gained international acclaim for his athletic achievements and widespread popularity, earning a prominent place among the world\\'s most renowned athletes, as per ESPN.[72][73] In 2014, American Appraisal conducted an evaluation of Kohli\\'s brand value and determined it to be $56.4 million, placing him fourth on the list of India\\'s most valued celebrity brands.[74] The following two years saw Kohli\\'s brand value soar higher. As per a report published in October 2016 by Duff & Phelps, Kohli\\'s brand worth had increased to $92 million, second only to that of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.[75] In 2017, Kohli was recognized by Forbes as the seventh \"Most Valuable Brand among Athletes\", surpassing renowned sports figures such as Lionel Messi, Rory McIlroy, and Stephen Curry, with a brand estimation of $14.5 million.[76] By September of the same year, Kohli had amassed endorsement agreements with 17 distinct brands, and he announced that he would only endorse products that he personally uses and believes in.[77] The following year, he was featured on Time magazine\\'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[78] In 2019, Kohli was the only cricketer included in Forbes\\' list of \"World\\'s 100 Highest-Paid Athletes\". He was ranked 100th on the list, with earnings estimated at $25 million, with $21 million being procured through endorsements, and the remainder from salary and tournament winnings.[79] Furthermore, in March 2019, Kohli was named the brand ambassador of the mobile esports platform, Mobile Premier League.[80] Kohli\\'s earning potential continued to climb, and in 2020, he attained the 66th spot in Forbes compilation of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020, with estimated earnings exceeding $26 million.[81] In April 2021, Vivo appointed Kohli as their brand ambassador ahead of the Indian Premier League.[82]\\nIn 2012, Kohli was recognized as one of the best-dressed men by the fashion magazine GQ, appearing on their annual list alongside prominent figures such as Barack Obama.[83] Six years later, in 2018, a documentary highlighting Kohli\\'s cricketing career was released on National Geographic channel. The film aimed to celebrate his accomplishments in the sport.[84] The following year, on the eve of the 2019 Cricket World Cup a tribute was bestowed upon Kohli. Madame Tussauds renowned for their lifelike wax figures, unveiled an exquisite creation of Kohli in London.[85] Continuing the string of accolades, in 2019, on the eleventh anniversary of his international debut, Kohli was honoured with a stand named after him at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi, making him the youngest cricketer to receive such a recognition.[86] In November of the same year, an Indian animated superhero television series entitled Super V premiered, featuring a fictionalized portrayal of Kohli\\'s teenage years and his discovery of superpowers.[87]\\n\\nPersonal life\\nKohli with wife Anushka Sharma in their Mumbai reception\\nKohli\\'s romantic association with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, which commenced in 2013, earned the duo the moniker of \"Virushka\".[88] During an interview with Graham Bensinger, Kohli divulged that he had encountered Sharma for the first time, when they were both were engaged in a promotional shoot for Clear shampoo.[89] Their union since then has attracted significant media interest, with persistent rumours and speculations swirling around in the press, as both parties remained reticent about publicly discussing the relationship.[90] On 11 December 2017, the couple exchanged nuptials in an intimate ceremony held in Florence, Italy, becoming one of the most talked-about celebrity couples in the country.[91] On 11 January 2021, the couple had their first child, a daughter, who was named Vamika.[92] The child\\'s name, Vamika, is derived from Sanskrit, meaning \"little goddess\".[93] On 15 February 2024, the couple welcomed their second child, a boy named Akaay.[94]\\nIn 2018, Kohli disclosed that he had made the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet in an effort to alleviate the symptoms of a cervical spine issue caused by elevated levels of uric acid. This condition was impacting his finger movements, and thus, affecting his performance as a batsman. He made a conscious effort to abstain from consuming meat, as part of his regimen for maintaining optimal health.[95] He has since clarified that his dietary choices do not align with a vegan lifestyle and he continues to consume dairy products.[96] Kohli is widely recognized for his physical fitness and intense training regimen.[97] He has been an advocate of leading a healthy lifestyle, which involves regular exercise and a nutritious diet. His hard work and discipline in this area have earned him the reputation of being one of the fittest cricketers in the world.[98]\\nKohli has acknowledged to harbour a belief in superstitions. He has publicly avowed his reliance upon various lucky charms and rituals that he feels serve to bring him good fortune on the cricket field. One such tradition involves the donning of black wristbands, which he adheres to as a talismanic tradition. Additionally, he is known to prefer a particular pair of gloves, which he has consistently worn due to their supposed propensity to bring him success.[9] Furthermore, Kohli has been observed sporting a kara, a traditional bangle often worn for religious or spiritual purposes, on his right arm since 2012.[99] In addition to the previously mentioned superstitions, Kohli has also established the ritual of consistently donning white shoes on the cricket field.[100] Kohli has tattoos of the revered Hindu deity Lord Shiva, the sacred syllable \"Om\", the names of his parents, Prem and Saroj, a tribal emblem, a representation of a serene monastery, a samurai warrior, the astrological symbol of the scorpion, and his ODl and Test match cap numbers.[101][102]\\n\\nOutside cricket\\nCommercial investments\\nKohli at the opening ceremony of the Pro Kabaddi League in June 2016\\nKohli invested in Indian Super League club FC Goa, which he co-owned as of 2024, reflects his ambition to support and cultivate the growth of football in India. Beyond the realm of cricket, this venture served as a future business opportunity for him, as he sought to diversify his portfolio after retirement from the sport.[103] In November 2014, Kohli partnered with Anjana Reddy\\'s Universal Sportsbiz (USPL) to launch the youth fashion brand WROGN. The brand specialized in men\\'s casual wear clothing and entered into collaborations with prominent retail outlets such as Myntra and Shopper\\'s Stop.[104] Additionally, in late 2014, Kohli became a shareholder and brand ambassador for the London-based social networking venture \"Sport Convo\". His involvement aimed to promote and raise awareness of the platform, which was focused on providing a space for sports fans to connect and engage with one another.[105]\\nIn 2015, Kohli invested a sum of ₹900 million (US$11\\xa0million) towards the establishment of a chain of health clubs and fitness centers throughout India. Dubbed as \"Chisel\", the network of gyms was established through a joint venture between Kohli, Chisel India, and CSE (Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment), the organization responsible for managing Kohli\\'s commercial pursuits.[106] In September of the same year, Kohli expanded his portfolio of sports-related investments by becoming a co-owner of the International Premier Tennis League franchise, UAE Royals.[107] In quick succession, he also became a co-owner of the JSW-owned Bengaluru Yodhas franchise in the Pro Wrestling League.[108]\\nIn the year 2016, Kohli embarked on a new venture, which aimed to promote fitness among children. He joined forces with Stepathlon Lifestyle to launch Stepathlon Kids. The initiative aimed to encourage young individuals to adopt healthy lifestyle habits and inculcate the love for physical activity.[109]\\nIn 2017, Kohli entered into a partnership with the German sportswear brand, Puma, to launch his athletic lifestyle brand, One8. This brand offers a range of sport-related apparel, footwear, and accessories designed for active individuals.[110] That same year, Kohli also established Nueva, a fine dining establishment located in New Delhi. The restaurant features a South American-inspired decor accentuated with Native American artwork, providing a distinctive culinary setting.[111] Kohli also established One8 Commune, a chain of restaurant-bars that offer a modern and sophisticated ambiance that appeals to a diverse age range. This marked his inaugural foray into the food and beverage industry. The first outlet of this restaurant was launched in 2017.[112]\\nIn 2022, Kohli and his spouse made an investment of ₹2.5 crore (equivalent to ₹2.9\\xa0crore or US$350,000 in 2023) in Digit, an insurance-based startup.[113] Additionally, they also extended their support to Blue Tribe, a startup that specializes in the production and distribution of plant-based meat products. Driven by his own inclination towards a plant-based diet, Kohli aims to raise awareness and encourage individuals to adopt more sustainable and environmentally conscious practices.[114]\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nVirat Kohli at charity dinner for Smile Foundation\\nIn 2013, Kohli established the \"Virat Kohli Foundation\" with a philanthropic objective to support underprivileged children.[115] The foundation collaborates with a selected group of NGOs to increase awareness and gather support for various causes that are instrumental in advancing their mission of promoting the welfare and well-being of these children.[116][117] In 2014, the foundation participated in a charity auction organized by eBay and Save the Children India, the proceeds of which were directed towards the education and healthcare of underprivileged children.[118] Kohli is dedicated to creating a brighter future for children by implementing sports-based programs and providing them with necessary resources, leveraging his connections and partnerships to uplift marginalized segments of society.[119]\\nKohli\\'s foundation has organized several charity events to raise funds for its causes, including football matches featuring prominent Indian cricketers and Bollywood actors. The first such event was a celebrity football match in collaboration with Abhishek Bachchan\\'s charity foundation, which drew significant media attention and was successful in raising funds.[120] In this match, Kohli captained the All Hearts FC against the All Stars FC, led by Abhishek Bachchan.[121] Another charity football match, dubbed the \"Celebrity Clasico\", was held in June 2016 in Mumbai, with Kohli once again leading the All Hearts FC against the All Stars FC, captained by Ranbir Kapoor. This event was also a major success in generating funds for charitable causes.[122]\\nIn 2016, the Virat Kohli Foundation entered into a partnership with Smile Foundation to promote the empowerment of underprivileged children and young people. To kickstart this initiative, Kohli organized a philanthropic dinner at Grand Hyatt, Mumbai, graced by the presence of cricketing luminaries such as MS Dhoni, Shikhar Dhawan, Yuvraj Singh, Ajinkya Rahane, and KL Rahul to support the cause of child and youth empowerment.[123] To advance the goals of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), which aims at creating a cleaner India, Kohli and the Indian cricket team, in collaboration with Anurag Thakur, undertook a cleaning initiative at the Eden Gardens on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti of 2016.[124]\\nPrior to a match against Sri Lanka in the 2017 Champions Trophy, Kohli hosted a benevolent gala event in London in support of the Justice and Care organization. The ball was arranged with the objective of increasing both funds and awareness for the humanitarian cause championed by Justice and Care. The organization endeavors to combat the pernicious issues of human trafficking and contemporary slavery.[125] In 2017, Kohli established the Athlete Development Programme (ADP) as a platform for nurturing and supporting aspiring young athletes. This initiative provides comprehensive guidance to these young athletes in areas such as coaching, training, fitness, competition, and nutrition, thereby fostering their growth and development. The program has proven beneficial to several young sports persons, including tennis player Swastika Ghosh and golfer Aadil Bedi.[126]\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Kohli and his wife Anushka Sharma pledged donations to the PM CARES Fund and the Maharashtra CM Relief Fund.[127] The couple has a strong passion for animal welfare and have made personal contributions towards wildlife relief efforts. Through his support of Awaaz, Kohli seeks to provide comprehensive medical services, shelter, and sustenance to stray animals.[128]\\n\\nCareer summary\\nMain article: List of international cricket centuries by Virat Kohli\\nKohli has made 80 centuries which includes 7 double centuries in international cricket—29 centuries including 7 double centuries in Test cricket, 50 centuries in One Day Internationals (ODIs) surpassing the record of Sachin Tendulkar, and 1 century in T20I.[129]\\n\\nTest match performance\\nAn innings-by-innings breakdown of Kohli\\'s Test batting career, showing runs scored (blue and red (not out) bars) and the black line is his career batting average.\\nODI match performance\\nAn innings-by-innings breakdown of Kohli\\'s ODI batting career, showing runs scored  (blue and red (not out) bars) and the black line is his career batting average.\\nT20I match performance\\nAn innings-by-innings breakdown of Kohli\\'s T20I batting career, showing runs scored (blue and red (not out) bars) and the black line is his career batting average.\\nKohli holds a prominent place in the annals of Indian cricket.

We also dis cuss how to accurately\\ndeﬁne the location and boundary of diseases.\\nKeywords: medical images, convolutional neural network, obj ect detection, semantic segmentation, analysis\\nINTRODUCTION\\nIn routine medical practice, a large number of medical images are produced in the process of\\nvarious examinations, such as radiology, ultrasound, endo scopy, ophthalmology, and pathology.\\nRadiationimagesincludeX-Ray,computedtomography(CT),ma gneticresonanceimaging(MRI),\\nand positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) . The ultrasound images\\ninclude normal ultrasound images and color Doppler ultrasoun d images. The endoscopic images\\ncontain white light endoscopy (WLE), chromoendoscopy (CE), a nd magnifying endoscopy-\\nnarrow-band imaging (ME-NBI). The images of ophthalmology de al with optical coherence\\ntomography (OCT) images, while the pathological images cover gross images and microscopic\\nimages (Figure1). Clinical doctors have to spend a great deal of time to screen a nd evaluate\\ntheseimages.\\nWith the development of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), AI indu stries gradually enter into medical\\nﬁelds, and involve in medical imaging analysis, that help doc tors to solve diagnostic problems\\nand improve eﬃciency ( 1). AI is a branch of computer science for designing and executi ng\\ntasks originally carried out by human intelligence ( 2). Machine learning (ML) is a kind of\\ntechnologies using computer to perform repetitive and well-deﬁ ned tasks ( 3–5). ML includes\\nsupervisedlearning,unsupervisedlearning,semi-supervise dlearning,andreinforcementlearning.\\nThe supervised learning means that the training dataset is la beled by medical experts. The\\nunsupervised learning means that the training dataset is unl abeled. The semi-supervised learning\\nmeans that a part of training data is labeled and others are unl abeled.

Convolutional neur al\\nnetwork(CNN)istherepresentativealgorithmofDL.\\nCNN AND ITS EXTENSION\\nThe research of CNN could be traced back to 1962, when Hubel\\nandWieselanalyzedthestructureofvisualcortexinthecat brain\\nand found that the biological visual information is transfe rred\\nthroughmulti-layerreceptivedomain( 7).Theytriedtoconstruct\\nsimilar algorithms to make the machine recognizes images.The construction and application of CNN developed rapidly\\nafter 1980.

This model utilized depth-wise separable convolutio ns\\nto compress model parameters and improve computing speed\\n(11). As a lightweight CNN, MobileNet can be set into mobile\\nequipment to achieve mobile prediction. To optimize the speed\\nand accuracy, Tan et al. introduced EﬃcientDet, which conta ins\\neightmodelstructures,includingEﬃcientDetD0toEﬃcient Det\\nD7(12).\\nImage classiﬁcation is the popular application of CNN\\nalgorithms.Recently,scientiststriedtointegratetradit ionalCNN\\nalgorithmswithobjectdetectionandsemanticsegmentatio n.The\\npurpose of object detection is to make sure whether there are\\nobjectsfrompredeﬁnedcategories.Forinstance,itcanbeus edto\\ndeterminetheexistenceandregionoftumorsonorgansortis sues\\nof medical images. If the target is present, it could be indica ted\\non spatial location. The object in images is marked by a frame\\n(likeaboundarybox)withtheconﬁdenceonthetopofboundar y\\nbox (13). Object detection can perform many tasks such as\\nlesion location, lesion tracking and image discrimination . The\\napplication of object detection in medical images is extremel y\\nwide. Semantic segmentation is another algorithm in which\\ncomputer segments images based on the pixels presented in the\\nimages. The semantic refers to the content of the image, and\\nthe segmentation means that diﬀerent objects in the image are\\nsegmented based on pixels. In semantic segmentation analysis ,\\neachpixelintheimageislabeled( 14).\\nTHE COMMON ALGORITHMS FOR\\nOBJECT DETECTION\\nObject detection in medical images refers to identify locat ion\\nof lesions and classify diﬀerent objects. Popular algorithms\\nincludeR-CNN,FastR-CNN,FasterR-CNN,PFN,PSPNet,SSD,\\nYOLO,CenterNet,andEﬃcientNet( 15,16).Objectdetectionhas\\ntwo steps: (1) the target feature extraction, and (2) classif ying\\nand positioning the objects. The target feature extraction o f\\nimage relies on CNN automatically. There are two types of\\nframeworksforobjectdetection:two-stagedetectionfram ework,\\nand one-stage detection framework. The former includes a\\npreprocessing step for generating object detection proposal an d\\na step for object detection. The latter has an integrated proc ess\\ncontaining both steps. The two-stage framework contains two\\nparts. The ﬁrst part is to extract CNN features of regions from\\nimages without category information. The second part is to us e\\ncategory-speciﬁc classiﬁer to determine the category label s. The\\none-stage framework includes SSD, YOLO and CenterNet and\\nEﬃcientNetseries,thatarerelativelyfastbutlessaccura te.Object\\ndetection algorithms get the predicted box through the prior\\nbox technology, and then adjust parameters of prior boxes to\\nobtain the result of the predicted box. Moreover, the CenterNe t\\nalgorithm could provide the center point detection by means of\\npredictedboxinimages( Figure2).\\nTheR-CNNmeanstheregionofCNN,whichisbasedonthe\\nframework of AlexNet. The processing of this framework begin s\\nfrom input images. Then the proposed regions are extracted\\nand CNN features are computed to achieve region classiﬁcatio n\\n(14). The Fast R-CNN solves some problems of R-CNN, and\\nimproves the detecting speed and quality. This framework usesa softmax classiﬁer and class-speciﬁc bounding box regressi on\\nsimultaneously. The speed is increased three to ten times in\\ntraining and testing sets. The Faster R-CNN also utilized CNN\\nto extract features and obtained region of interest (ROI) usin g\\nregion proposal network. The most important improvement of\\nFaster R-CNN is to establish an integrated, simpler, and fast er\\nobjectdetectionframeworkreliedonCNNs.Linetal.introd uced\\nfeature pyramid model into Faster R-CNN to establish feature\\npyramidnetwork(FPN)toachievestate-of-the-artresultwi thout\\nsacriﬁcing speed and internal storage, which is more suitabl e for\\nsmallobjectdetection.Thebackbonenetworkoffeaturepyra mid\\nmodel utilizes ResNet with three additional parts, including\\nbottom-up pathway, top-down pathway and lateral connection\\n(17).However,thedisadvantagesofthetwo-stageframeworkar e\\ntherequirementoflargeresourcesforcomputation.\\nTo overcome the above shortcomings, scientists developed\\nthe detection strategy of one-stage framework. In one-stag e\\nframework, all computation is encapsulated in a single networ k.\\nYOLO is the abbreviation of You-Only-Look-Once. YOLO\\nsolved an object detection problem as a regression problem.\\nThe input images are proposed with an inference that enabled\\nthe position and category of all objects in the images. YOLO\\nis originated from GoogLeNet containing 24 convolution lay ers\\nandtwofullyconnectionlayers.Ituseda1 ×1convolutionlayer\\nand a 3×3 convolution layer to replace the Inception structure\\n(18,19). Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) ( 15) is faster\\nthanYOLOandcompetitivewithregion-baseddetectorssucha s\\nFaster R-CNN with a higher accuracy. SSD inherits the method\\nof transforming detection to regression, and completes regi on\\nproposalsandclassiﬁcationinonestage.Itimprovestherunni ng\\nspeedanddetectionaccuracycomparedwithotherframeworks.\\nMost of the one-stage framework can adjust parameters of prior\\nboxes to show all potential object locations and classify obje cts\\nin detection results. This detecting method takes too much t ime\\nand reduces detection eﬃciency. The CenterNet model achiev es\\nimprovement in speed and accuracy. The key-point estimation\\nis utilized in CenterNet to ﬁnd the central point and go back\\nto other object properties that do not need detection of all\\npotential objects with high accuracy. Whereas, the EﬃcientD et\\ndesigned by Tan et al. used EﬃcientNet as backbone, and\\nconstructed bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) to\\nobtaincontinuousfusionofup-samplingandsub-sampling( 12).\\nTHE COMMON ALGORITHMS FOR\\nSEMANTIC SEGMENTATION\\nBeforedeeplearningwasappliedtocomputervision,researcher s\\nalways use TextonForest or Random Forest to construct the\\nclassiﬁer for semantic segmentation.

The current popular\\nalgorithms for semantic segmentation include FCN, SegNet,\\nPSPNet, DeepLab and UNet ( 20–22).

The most important\\nchange of FCN is that all fully connected layers are replaced by\\nconvolutionallayers.ThestructureofFCNincludesconvol ution,\\nupsampling and skip connection. FCN can accept input images\\nof any size and avoid repetition of storing and calculating th e\\nconvolution. In 2015, Badrinarayanan et al. proposed SegNet, a\\nnew framework of semantic segmentation ( 23). This framework\\nis based on FCN and constructs an encoder-decoder structure\\nbasedonVGG16.Itistheﬁrsttimetoutilizesymmetricnetwo rk\\nstructure and had good performance on semantic segmentation .\\nBased on FCN, PSPNet utilizes pre-trained ResNet101 as the\\nfeature extraction layer and introduces the pyramid pooling\\nmodule to identify the prior information of the context in the\\nimage. It has fantastic understanding and higher identiﬁca tion\\nof complex scenes ( 24). Ronneberger et al. proposed U-Netalgorithm for semantic segmentation in 2015. In UNet analysi s,\\ntwo steps of feature extraction, sub-sample and up-sample are\\nneeded. Since the network structure is like the letter “U,” i t is\\ncalledUNet( 22).TheUNetmodelissimplewithfewparameters.\\nIt is suitable for the classiﬁcation of medical images with s mall\\ndataset. In medical imaging analysis, it is easy to overﬁt if\\nmore parameters are involved in the model. Therefore, the\\nUNet model performs well in most medical imaging analysis.\\nTo improve the eﬃciency, Zhou et al. introduced UNet ++,\\na nested UNet architecture for medical image segmentation.\\nUNet++borrowed the dense connection of DenseNet and\\nimproved the skip connection structure of UNet ( 25).The VNet\\nis constructed to satisfy the need of analyzing 3D images in C T\\nand MRI images, that have similar structure of UNet ( 26).

Hirasawa et\\nal. used SSD to diagnose gastric cancer in chromoendoscopic\\nimages. The training dataset consisted of 13,584 images and\\nthe test dataset included 2,296 images from 77 gastric lesio ns\\nin 69 patients. The SSD performed well to extract suspicious\\nlesions and evaluate early gastric cancer. The result showed that\\nthe time spent for analyzing 2,296 images is 47s, and the total\\nsensitivity was 92.2%.

And then, object d etection and semantic\\nsegmentation are developed. The two algorithms are further divided into different branches including FCN, UNet and Dee pLab, faster RCNN, SSD, and YOLO. The\\nends of each branch correspond to the application in various medical images. Endo refers to endoscopic images. OCT means the images of optical coherence\\ntomography.\\nR-CNN. The analysis was divided into two stages, the initial\\nlearning stage for training and the precise learning stage fo r\\nﬁne-tuning and testing. The result showed that, in the initi al\\nlearning stage, the recall rates of nodule classes for train ing set\\nand validation set, the mAP was 0.5019 and AUC was 0.8995.\\nIn the precise learning stage, the mAP and AUC were 0.7801\\nand 0.9541, which was obviously improved, compared to initial\\nlearningstage.Thus,theFasterR-CNNmodelhadhighjudgme nt\\neﬀectiveness and recognition accuracy for CT diagnosis of per i-\\ngastricmetastaticlymphnodes( 16).\\nTHE APPLICATION OF SEMANTIC\\nSEGMENTATION IN MEDICAL IMAGE\\nANALYSIS\\nForaccuratedelineationoflesionsborder,sematicsegmen tation\\nbased on CNN backbones has a potential application.

The accuracy of using this system was 95.5%\\nin the internal validation dataset, 92.7% for the prospective\\nvalidation dataset, and 91.5 to 97.7% for the external valid ation\\ndataset.

Besides accurate delineation of\\ntumor margin, for beast MRI images, Piantadosi et al. aimed\\nto construct and modify a DCNN model based on UNet to\\nachieve3DMRIimagesegmentationofbreastparenchymafrom\\nother tissues. There were two datasets, the ﬁrst dataset was a\\nprivate dataset and the second one was a public breast MR\\nimage dataset. After training and testing, the result showe d\\nthat the modiﬁed model performed better and the median dice\\nsimilarity coeﬃcient (DSC) for both the datasets was 96.60\\nand 95.78% ( 37). At present, the contradiction between a large\\nnumber of pathological images and a shortage of pathologists\\nwas a problem worldwide. There is a great opportunity in\\nthe ﬁeld of pathology for deep learning algorithm. Cai et al.\\nconstructed a multi-input model called MIFNet to segment\\nlesions in pathological images, and increase the dice coeﬃci ent\\nto 81.87%. That was a great progress because the dice coeﬃcient\\nin some existing segmentation models was relatively low, i. e.,\\n67.73% in UNet, and 63.89% in SegNet. They believed that\\nsemantic segmentation algorithm was suitable for analyzing\\npathological images ( 38). In addition, the ENDOANGEL model\\nnot only realized automatic object detection during endosc opic\\nexamination, but also realized semantic segmentation.

The\\nresult showed that the FCN performed better than other two\\nmodels(39).\\nCONCLUSION\\nBoth object detection and semantic segmentation algorithm s\\nare based on CNN. They are widely applied in variousﬁelds of medical imaging study, particularly in the digestive\\nsystem, respiratory system, endocrine system, cardiovascu lar\\nsystem, brain, eye, and breast. These algorithms can be\\nused to analyze multiple images including radiation images\\n(CT, MRI, and PET), pathological images, ultrasound\\nimages, and endoscopic images. The development of\\nvarious algorithms and their application are presented\\ninFigure4.\\nHowever, there are some limitation of object detection\\nand semantic segmentation in the application of analyzing\\nmedical images. In the model training stage, a large\\nnumber of medical images are needed. In addition, both\\nobject detection and semantic segmentation belongs\\nto supervised algorithms, which require experienced\\ndoctors to label images. Therefore, future study should\\nfocus on how to use limited medical images to get good\\ntrainingresults.\\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\\nYY and RY designed the study. RY wrote the\\nmanuscript.
